            Welcome to the **AI Assisted Trading Portfolio Manager**! This application helps you track and manage your investment portfolio with powerful analytics.

            ### 1. **Initial Setup**

            The application supports two data provider modes:

            | Provider Mode | Source | Typical Use | Notes |
            | ------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----- |
            | Legacy | Yahoo Finance (yfinance) | Default historical + quotes | Broad coverage, no bid/ask microstructure |
            | Micro (Production) | Finnhub | Quotes, profiles, news, earnings | Access depends on API key plan |
            | Micro (Dev) | Synthetic Generator | Deterministic offline data | No live market dependency |

            **Current Finnhub capability detection** (runtime checks at startup):
            - Quotes: ‚úî (used for Current Price, PnL, % Change)
            - Company Profile (exchange, sector, market cap): ‚úî
            - Company News: ‚úî (used for catalyst hints)
            - Earnings Calendar: ‚úî (next earnings date)
            - Daily Candles (OHLCV): ‚úñ *Not available on this plan* (ADV20 & historical volatility omitted)
            - Bid/Ask (spread): ‚úñ *Not available on this plan* (Spread column omitted)

            When a capability is unavailable:
            - Related columns (e.g., ADV20, Spread) are hidden or marked *N/A*.
            - Daily Summary liquidity metrics are skipped with a note.
            - No repeated API retries after a permission (403) response (reduces noise & quota use).

            **Future Expansion Points**
            - Liquidity Metrics: If candle access is granted, 20-day average volume (ADV20) and rolling volatility will auto-populate.
            - Microstructure: If bid/ask becomes available, spread and implied slippage metrics can be displayed.
            - Additional Catalysts: Corporate actions / insider transactions if exposed by provider.

            **Synthetic Mode (dev_stage)**
            - Generates deterministic OHLCV paths for rapid UI development & testing.
            - Provides pseudo profile, news, and earnings placeholders.
            - Ensures zero external network usage for offline hacking.

            To switch provider modes:
            1. Set `ENABLE_MICRO_PROVIDERS=1` in `.env`.
            2. Set `APP_ENV=production` and add `FINNHUB_API_KEY=...` for live Finnhub.
            3. Use `APP_ENV=dev_stage` with the flag for synthetic data.
