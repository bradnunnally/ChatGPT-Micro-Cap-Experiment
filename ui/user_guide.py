            Welcome to the **AI Assisted Trading Portfolio Manager**! This application helps you track and manage your investment portfolio with powerful analytics.

            ### 1. **Initial Setup**
            - **Add Cash**: Start by adding funds to your account using the cash management section on the Dashboard

            - View your current cash balance and total portfolio value
            - See all your current holdings with real-time prices
            - Monitor unrealized gains/losses for each position
            - Access buy and sell forms for trading

            ### 3. **Trading Operations**
            - **Buying Stocks**: Use the buy form to purchase shares by entering ticker symbol, quantity, and price
            - **Selling Stocks**: Use the sell form to close positions (full or partial sales)
            - **Real-time Validation**: All trades are validated against current market prices
            - **Automatic Updates**: Portfolio values update automatically with live market data

            ### 4. **Watchlist Management**

            - **Logs**: macOS bundle writes to `~/Library/Logs/PortfolioManager/streamlit.out` for troubleshooting
            - **Testing**: Run `pytest` in the project directory to execute the test suite (coverage gate enforced at 80%)

            The application uses a unified provider architecture with two runtime sources:

            | Mode | Source | Typical Use | Notes |
            | ---- | ------ | ----------- | ----- |
            | Production | Finnhub | Live quotes, profiles, news, earnings | Requires `FINNHUB_API_KEY` |
            | Development | Synthetic Generator | Deterministic offline quotes & history | Zero network usage |

            **Capability Detection (automatic):**
            - Quotes, Profile, News, Earnings Calendar: Enabled when a Finnhub API key is present.
            - Daily Candles & Bid/Ask: Shown only if your plan grants access; otherwise related columns (ADV20, Spread) are hidden.

            When a capability is unavailable:
            - Dependent columns are omitted (e.g., Spread, ADV20).
            - No repeated retries after 403 permission errors.

            **Synthetic Mode (`APP_ENV=dev_stage`):**
            - Generates deterministic OHLCV paths for rapid UI & test feedback.
            - Supplies placeholder profile/news/earnings data.
            - Safe for offline development and CI (no external calls).

            **Switching Modes:**
            1. For production: set `APP_ENV=production` and export `FINNHUB_API_KEY`.
            2. For development: set `APP_ENV=dev_stage` (synthetic data auto-selected).
            3. Toggle provider usage in the UI if a manual override is exposed.

            **Planned Enhancements:**
            - Automatic activation of liquidity metrics when candle access becomes available.
            - Bid/ask spread & microstructure metrics when level 1 quotes permit.
            - Additional catalysts (corporate actions, insider activity) where supported.
